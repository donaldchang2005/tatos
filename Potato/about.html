      <h2>Potato</h2>
      <p>The potato is a starchy root vegetable native to the Americas that is consumed as a staple food in many parts of the world.Potatoes are tubers of the plant Solanum tuberosum, a perennial in the nightshade family Solanaceae.
       The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated by Native Americans independently in multiple locations, but studies would later trace the potatoes single origin, in the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia. Potatoes were domesticated there about 7,000â€“10,000 years ago from a species in the S. brevicaule complex.Many varieties of the potato are cultivated in the Andes region of South America, where the species is indigenous.</p>

          <h2>Potatoes in history</h2>
          <p>The potatoes were first domesticated in Peru and northwestern Bolivia. The cultivation of the potatoes can be traced back to as late as 10,000 years ago in South America. Its arrival in Europe was around the 1530s when Spanish Conquistadors bought the vegetable back to Europe, where it wasnt very popular and used as feed for animals or eaten out of desperation, however over the decades it would become more popular and widely accepted.
            The potato would also play an important role in the Industiral Revolution(1760-1840), since the plant needed little space, was so easy to grow and yielded so much produce, it would become a very popular food staple among the working class and would then lead to a population boom resulting in more workers for the growing factories.
